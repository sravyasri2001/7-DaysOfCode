To simply say,
Dynamic Programming = Recursion + Memoization

How to check for DP properties?
If a problem can be solved recursively by calling same input number of times,It can be solved using DP.

Steps to solve using DP
1.See how the problems are defined in terms of subproblems recursively.(Recursion)
2.Check whether we can use some kind table or data structure.(Memoization)


Process of obtaining solution 
1.Complete understanding of the problem plays major role in initiating the solution.
2.After getting a complete idea on what is needed and what can be used, always try to obtain a recursive solution(naive).
3.Try to improve it and include edge,base cases.
4.Now try to use data structures like arrays,vectors,matrices or heaps inorder to store the repeatedly calculated values.
5.After submitting the solution,Try checking editorials and discussions so that we can understand different ways to solve the problem and the other hand we can find efficient algorithms as well.
