To simply say,
Dynamic Programming = Recursion + Memoization

How to check for DP properties?
If a problem can be solved recursively by calling same input number of times,It can be solved using DP.

Steps to solve using DP
See how the problems are defined in terms of subproblems recursively.(Recursion)
Check whether we can use some kind table or data structure.(Memoization)
