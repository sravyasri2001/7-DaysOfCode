# 7-DaysOfCode


# This Repository refers to challenge of 7-DaysOfCode that I have committed voluntarily,where I will be uploading all files of code at the end of the 7th day.(31st August 2020)
1.The main reason behind uploading it at the end is so that I can revise all concepts at a glance at the end of period.

2.And the other reason is I can come to a conclusion on what I have learned and what new challenges can I commit to.

# Problems that uses dynamic programming algorithms to work efficiently.
1.The upcoming repositories will contain the basic solution function without any driver code.The main objective is to concentrate on the essence of the problem instead of reading inputs.

2.A set of 2 or 3 problems would be done everyday inorder to kick start with dynamic programming.

# Why pushing into Github?
1.Dynamic Programming is a bit difficult and tricky to get into,and is very important,I can call it as mandatory for Product based companies.

2.As a 4 month old DP programmer(Beginner),I would first solve the most frequently asked DP questions so that I would get to know the concept importance and type of asking them.

3.Maintaining all of them at a place would actually help anyone of us to revise a bit faster.

4.Comparing myself from day to day to improve from writing naive algorithms to the most efficient ones.

# References
1.I consider myself as a beginner ,So I would go with geeksforgeeks to learn and for practice as well.(Best platform to expertise in competitive Programming)

2.After learning concepts ,I will practice in Leetcode and hackerrank to get to know the style of presenting the question.
